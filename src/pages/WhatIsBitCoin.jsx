            Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a virtual currency designed to act as
            money and a form of payment outside the control of any one person,
            group, or entity, and thus removing the need for third-party
            involvement in financial transactions. It is rewarded to blockchain
            miners for the work done to verify transactions and can be purchased
            on several exchanges.

            Bitcoin was introduced to the public in 2009 by an anonymous
            developer or group of developers using the name Satoshi Nakamoto.
            <br />
            <br />
            It has since become the most well-known cryptocurrency in the world.
            Its popularity has inspired the development of many other
            cryptocurrencies. These competitors either attempt to replace it as
            a payment system or are used as utility or security tokens in other
            blockchains and emerging financial technologies.
